# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

# HTML & CSS

# Description

This phase of the Airbnb Clone focuses on the HTML and CSS implementation. The Images folder contains various icons used throughout the site, such as the logo, bathroom icons, bedroom icons, and guest icons. In the Styles folder, you'll find CSS files responsible for styling the website. For each category (e.g., common, footer, header, places), the CSS file with the highest number is the most relevant and represents the final styling for that category. Similarly, the index.html file with the highest number is the most relevant version of the website and reflects the finished product.
