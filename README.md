# AIRBNB CLONE PROJECT

## DESCRIPTION

This project seeks to make a replica of the AirBnb website. The first phase of this project is to build a command interpreter to manage all AirBnb Objects.

All files in this repository seek to do the following:

1. Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
2. Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
3. Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
4. Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
5. Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
